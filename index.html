    <p>
      A <strong>cherry blossom</strong> also known as
      <strong>Japanese cherry</strong> or <strong>Sakura</strong> is a flower of
      many trees of genus Prunus or Prunus subg. Cerasus. They are also a common
      species in East Asia, including China, Korea, and especially in Japan.
      They generally refer to ornamental cherry trees, not to be confused with
      cherry trees that produce fruit for eating. It is considered the

      of Japan.

      Many of the cherry trees currently enjoyed for cherry blossom viewing are
      not wild species but
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar"
        title="cultivar"
        target="_blank"
        >cultivar</a
      >. Because cherry trees have a mutable trait, many cultivars have been
      created for cherry blossom viewing, especially in Japan. Since the Heian
      period, the Japanese have produced many cultivars by selecting superior or
      mutant individuals that were born from natural crossings of wild cherry
      trees, or by crossing them artificially, and then breeding them by
      <strong>grafting</strong> and <strong>cutting</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oshima cherry, Yamazakura, Prunus pendula f.ascendens (syn, Prunus
      itosakura, Edo higan), and so on, which grow naturally in Japan, are easy
      to mutate, and especially Oshima cherry, which is an

      >
      species in Japan, tend to mutate into double-flowered, grow fast, have
      many large flowers, and have a strong fragrance; therefore, Oshima cherry
      has produced many sakura called Sato-zakura Group as a base of cultivars
      because of its favorable characteristics. The representative cultivars
      whose parent species is Oshima cherry are Yoshino cherry and Kanzan;
      Yoshino cherries are actively planted in Asian countries, and Kanzan is
      actively planted in Western countries.

    <h2>Time of flowering</h2>
    <p>
      Many wild species and cultivars bloom from March to April in the Northern
      Hemisphere. Wild species, even if they are the same species, are
      genetically different from one tree to another, so that even if they are
      planted in the same place, there is some variation in the time when they
      reach full bloom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flowering time of cherry trees is thought to be affected by global
      warming and the
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_island_effect"
        target="_blank"
        title="heat island effect"
        >heat island effect</a
      >
      of urbanization. According to the record of full bloom dates of Yamazakura
      (Prunus jamasakura) in Kyoto, Japan, which was recorded for about 1200
      years, the time of full bloom was relatively stable from 812 to 1800s, but
      after that, the time of full bloom rapidly became earlier and in 2021, the
      earliest full bloom date in 1200 years was recorded. The average peak day
      in the 1850s was around April 17, but in the 2020s it was April 5, during
      which time the average temperature rose by about 6 degrees (3.4 Celsius).
      According to the record of full bloom dates of Yoshino cherry in the Tidal
      Basin in Washington, D.C., around 1921 it was April 5, but around 2021 it
      was March 31. These records are consistent with the record of rapid
      increases in global mean temperature since the mid-1800s.

    <h2>Flower viewing in Japan</h2>
    <p>
      "Hanami" is the centuries-old practice of drinking under a blooming sakura
      (桜 or 櫻; さくら or サクラ) or <strong>ume tree</strong>. The custom is
      said to have started during the Nara period (710–794), when it was ume
      blossoms that people admired in the beginning, but by the Heian period
      (794–1185), cherry blossoms had come to attract more attention, and
      'hanami' was synonymous with 'sakura'. From then on, in both

      and

        target="_blank"
        title="haiku"
        >haiku</a
      >, "flowers" (花, hana) meant "cherry blossoms". The custom was originally
      limited to the elite of the Imperial Court, but soon spread to samurai
      society and, by the Edo period, to the common people as well. Tokugawa
      Yoshimune planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under
      the sakura trees, people had lunch and drank
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake" target="_blank" title="sake"

      >
      in cheerful feasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since a book written in the Heian period mentions "weeping cherry"
      ('しだり櫻, 糸櫻'), one of the cultivars with pendulous branches, it is
      considered that
      <strong>Prunus itosakura 'Pendula' (Sidare-zakura)</strong> is the oldest
      cultivar in Japan.

        <strong>Prunus × subhirtella</strong>, the
        <strong>winter-flowering cherry</strong>,
        <strong>spring cherry</strong>, or <strong>rosebud cherry</strong>, is
        the scientific name for the hybrid between Prunus itosakura and Prunus
        incisa. It is a small deciduous flowering tree originating in Japan, but
        unknown in the wild.

    <h2>Cultivars</h2>
    <p>
      Japan has a wide variety of cherry blossoms (sakura); well over 200
      cultivars can be found there. According to another classification method,
      it is thought that there are more than 600 cultivars in Japan. According
      to the results of DNA analysis of 215 cultivars carried out by Japan's
      Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute in 2014, many of the
      cultivars of cherry trees that have spread around the world are
      interspecific hybrids that were produced by crossing Oshima cherry and
      Prunusu jamasakura (Yamazakura) with various wild species. Among these
      cultivars, the Sato-zakura Group, and many cultivars have a large number
      of petals, and the representative cultivar is Prunus serrulata 'Kanzan'.
